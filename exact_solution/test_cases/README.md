# Stores test cases for Max Clique Algorithms
## Format
Input consists of 2 types. The first line states the number of vertices (n) in the graph. The next n lines 
are tuples that state the vertex ID followed by all neighbour vertices.

0. no nodes
1. one node
2. two nodes that are connected
3. a complete 3 node graph
4. a 3 node graph with no edges
5. Textbook Independent Set to Max Clique Graph
