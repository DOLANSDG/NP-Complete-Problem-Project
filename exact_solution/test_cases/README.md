# Stores test cases for Max Clique Algorithms
## Format
For Max Clique the input is an undirected graph. The first line will list the number of edges m. The remaining m lines will be a flat edge list with the edges specified only once and the names of the vertices inferred from the edge list. 
The vertices are inferred from the edge list. 

# quick details of each
0. no nodes or no edges
1. one node;  1 node; loop edge
2. two nodes that are connected; 2 nodes; 1 edge
3. 3 node complete graph
4. 2 "3 node complete graphs" connected by a middle vertex; Testing two equal maximal cliques
5. Textbook Independent Set to Max Clique Graph; 8 nodes; 16 edges
6. Wikipedia Example; 6 nodes; 7 edges
